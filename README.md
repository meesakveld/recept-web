# Recipe Book

Welcome to the Recipe Book repository! This project is a recipe book web application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete recipes. 

The project has a front-end and back-end component. The front-end is built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back-end is built using Node.js and Express.js. The data is stored in a JSON file.

This project was my first full-stack web development project where i became familiar with the more backend side of web development. Such as routing, handling requests, and working with data.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone
    ```
2. Install the dependencies in the back-end folder
    ```bash
    cd back-end && npm install
    ```
3. Start the server
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4. Open in the front-end folder `index.html` in your browser with a live server extension. I recommend using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for Visual Studio Code.

5. You can now view the Recipe Book web application in your browser!
